## User Experience

The target audience for Niche Crystals is individuals wanting to find more information about the supposed properties of healing crystals and their origin. It is expected the users will be of a beginner level, therefore the site contains simple content to provide an overview of the different uses of crystals and inviting images to provide a positive experience. The Niche Crystals site is intended to encourage users to sign up for a monthly newsletter subscription to find out more about crystals.

## User Stories

### As a user I would like to learn how crystals are used

The homepage of the Niche Crystals site offers an initial overview of the different practices wherein crystals are used, alongside listing individual properties of the more commonly known crystals. Accompanying this the Gallery page offers images of crystals being used in meditation, crystal readings and jewellry to give a pleasing visual of the potential uses of crystals for mindfulness.

### The website should be user friendly on all available devices

Through the use of media queries within the CSS code, the website is adaptable to all screensizes from mobile view to larger desktop screens. The use of flexbox has allowed for the adjustments of elements on each page ensuring a smooth flow of information in either columns or row formats as applicable. For smaller screen sizes the navigation bar has been adjusted to a dropdown option to create a more user friendly experience and ease of navigation through each page of the site.

### As a user I want additional information on how to introduce new practices and meet like minded people to discuss crystals

The footer of the site includes social media links that are intended to take the user to a group page they can join as an initial pathway to learn more. The final page also includes an easy to complete sign up form for a monthly newsletter containing more information about crystals and upcoming events accross the UK. The sign up form asks the user how they hope crystals can help them to allow for personalisation of the newsletters to ensure future content is user specific.

# Design

## Colour Scheme

![colour scheme image](X)
The colour scheme has been inspired by crystals in particular amathyst crystals, with the various purple and pink tones making up the majority of the website. These colours are also represented in the favicon icon for the website to create consistency for the branded image. Text is either in black or white dependant on the background for contrast and easier reading for the user. Using the Adobe Color Accessibility Tools the colour scheme is also confirmed to be suitable for colour blind users.

## Typogrophy

The Niche Crystals site contains two fonts, Pontano Sans for the header of eage page, and Montserrat for the body of the pages. I have chosen these two font types as they do not contradict one another and create a consistent styling for the website. Both fonts are also clear and easy to read to be more accesible for all users. Please see the two fonts shown below;
![pontano sans font image](X)
![montserrat font image](X)

## Imagery

The images chosen for the website have been selected due to their high quality on all screen sizes and their relevancy for the website. Most images are included within the gallery page, and have been selected to follow consistent stylings and sizes for a sleek appearance on the page. All images used on the website have also been formatted as WEBP documents as these provide to be 25% to 35% smaller than JPEG files resulting in quicker loading times for the user.

## Wireframes

Using Balsamiq during the planning stage of this build I was able to create wireframes for each page and mobile view to use as a guide when building the website.

## Search Engine Optimization

In order to improve the optimization of the website's content relevance, and the quality and quantity of website traffic I have included `<meta>` tags within the head elements. These tags will create the small description for the website when coming up within the output of a search engine, alongside the addition of keywords to increase the ranking of the website on the search engine's output.

# Features

## General Features

### Navigation Bar

Within the head of the page I've included a responsive navbar changing from text in desktop view to a hamburger menu drop down in mobile view. The navbar shows the current page by underlining the relevant text with a lighter font colour.

#### Desktop View

![navbar desktop image](X)

#### Mobile View

### Landing Page

The Landing Page for Niche Crystals opens with a high quality image of crystals with text overlay as a brief introduction to the site. The user is able to scroll down to view the main content offering information regarding the origins of crystals and their uses. For desktop users the main content is shown with images and text alongside one another and alternating positions for each text subject. Each subject includes a link to the sign up page encouraging users to sign up for more information.

### Gallery Page

The Gallery Page of the website providss users with relevant images laid out in a responsive mosaic tile gallery to show the different ways in which crystals can be used. Towards the end of the page there is also a video showing a crystal being cleansed through the smudging method to give a visual representation on the use of crystals. This page is valuable to the users as it compliments the textual information given from the Landing Page.
![gallery page image](X)

### Sign Up Page

The final page of the website includes a sign up form allowing the user to sign up for a monthly newsletter, tailored to them, with further information regarding crystal practices and maintenance. The user can specify how they intend to use crystals alongside submitting their full name and email address to then submit the form. At this time there is no backend service connected to the website as this is not currently withint the scope of this project; with this in mind once a user has completed the form a template formdump page provided by Code Institute. If the form is incorrectly completed pop ups will appear to advise the user of the form requirements.

### Page Footer

The footer on eage page includes social media links for Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest and Twitter encouraging the user to stay connected through relative social groups. The links will open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user and avoiding any progress on the main website being lost.

## Future Implementations

An initial future feature could be further compression or reselection of gallery images to improve the performance levels to be more reliable on devices with varying performance levels. Using the Google Lighthouse Developer Tool I was able to see the webpage performance on the gallery page was less reliable than the other pages on the site.
A broader goal for future implementations would be the inclusion of an Store page allowing the website owner to offer relative products for the user to purchase, such as crystals, jewellry and further reading materials.

## Accessibility

To provide accessibility to the website the following has been incorporated;

- Aria-labels, alt tags and labels have been used for supportive technologies such as screen readers.
- Semantic elements have been used for easy navigation through each page.
- The colour scheme selected is also made suitable for colour blind users.

When looking for bug solutions I may use of the following;

- As a general guide when completing the readme.md file I have used a [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
- To fix the movement of the navbar on the sign up page I referred to a [Bootstap Forum](https://forum.bootstrapstudio.io/t/vertical-scroll-bar-moves-fixed-nav-bar-to-left/2309)
- To make the video element more responsive to screensizes I referred to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20127763/video-100-width-and-height)
- I found the [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-accessibility) webpage very useful when determining the best colour scheme.

## Content

- The content has been written using my own knowledge of crystals.
- The icons in the footer and within the home page and sign up page were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

## Media
