## User Experience

The target audience for Niche Crystals is individuals wanting to find more information about the supposed properties of healing crystals and their origin. It is expected the users will be of a beginner level, therefore the site contains simple content to provide an overview of the different uses of crystals and inviting images to provide a positive experience. The Niche Crystals site is intended to encourage users to sign up for a monthly newsletter subscription to find out more about crystals.

## User Stories

### As a user I would like to learn how crystals are used

The homepage of the Niche Crystals site offers an initial overview of the different practices wherein crystals are used, alongside listing individual properties of the more commonly known crystals. Accompanying this the Gallery page offers images of crystals being used in meditation, crystal readings and jewellry to give a pleasing visual of the potential uses of crystals for mindfulness.

### The website should be user friendly on all available devices

Through the use of media queries within the CSS code, the website is adaptable to all screensizes from mobile view to larger desktop screens. The use of flexbox has allowed for the adjustments of elements on each page ensuring a smooth flow of information in either columns or row formats as applicable. For smaller screen sizes the navigation bar has been adjusted to a dropdown option to create a more user friendly experience and ease of navigation through each page of the site.

### As a user I want additional information on how to introduce new practices and meet like minded people to discuss crystals

The footer of the site includes social media links that are intended to take the user to a group page they can join as an initial pathway to learn more. The final page also includes an easy to complete sign up form for a monthly newsletter containing more information about crystals and upcoming events accross the UK. The sign up form asks the user how they hope crystals can help them to allow for personalisation of the newsletters to ensure future content is user specific.

# Design

## Colour Scheme

![colour scheme image](X)
The colour scheme has been inspired by crystals in particular amathyst crystals, with the various purple and pink tones making up the majority of the website. These colours are also represented in the favicon icon for the website to create consistency for the branded image. Text is either in black or white dependant on the background for contrast and easier reading for the user. Using the Adobe Color Accessibility Tools the colour scheme is also confirmed to be suitable for colour blind users.

## Typogrophy

The Niche Crystals site contains two fonts, Pontano Sans for the header of eage page, and Montserrat for the body of the pages. I have chosen these two font types as they do not contradict one another and create a consistent styling for the website. Both fonts are also clear and easy to read to be more accesible for all users. Please see the two fonts shown below;

## Imagery

The images chosen for the website have been selected due to their high quality on all screen sizes and their relevancy for the website. Most images are included within the gallery page, and have been selected to follow consistent stylings and sizes for a sleek appearance on the page. All images used on the website have also been formatted as WEBP documents as these provide to be 25% to 35% smaller than JPEG files resulting in quicker loading times for the user.

## Wireframes

Using Balsamiq during the planning stage of this build I was able to create wireframes for each page and mobile view to use as a guide when building the website.
