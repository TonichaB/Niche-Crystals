            <p>
              Going back to ancient times, in places like Greece, Eqypt and
              China, crystals have been used with the belief they held healing
              properties for the mind, body, and soul. Whilst there currently is
              no scientific evidence confirming the healing properties of
              crystals, those who do believe understand crystals to carry
              energies that can be transferred to us and help to rid negative
              energies.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are said to be many properties held by crystals including
              protection, abundance, love and wisdom. Some crystals are also
              said to have energy amplifying properties, such as clear quartz,
              and are used with the intention of amplifying positive energies
              surrounding a person or an environment. Head over to our Sign Up

            <p>
              There are many different rituals practiced with the use of
              crystals including meditation, baths, alters, chakra cleanses and
              more. Different crystals will cary their own energy types and so
              the rituals completed will be deeply personal for everyone,
              providing a space for mindfullness and reflection. In essence,
              crystals are used as a form of self-care to de-stress and find
              clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of the more common crystals used include, Amathyst, Citrine,
              Turquoise, Quartz, Jasper, Tigers Eye and many more. When
              obtaining your first crystals it is important to clease them as
              soon as possible in order to remove any energies still attached to
              the crystals from the previous owners. Depending on the type of
              crystal there are different methods that can be used to clease
              them, some crystals can be submerged in water and placed in the
              moonlight but not all. Those not able to be submerged in water can
              be cleansed through a process called Smudging, where sage is burnt
              and the crystals placed within the smoke. Check out our Gallery
              Page for a video showing a smudging clease!
